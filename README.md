# Student Performance Predictor

In this project we are developing Flask Application which can predict the Maths Score of the students. This is an end to end Machine learning portfolio project which involves the Exploratory Analysis, Model Development and Model training. Machine Learning Project is implemented with MLOps and CI/CD pipelines. MLOps consists of Data Ingestion, Data Transformation, Model Trainer, Model Evaluation and Model Deployment.

## Problem Statement 

This app predicts the math score of the students by providing the other features. App will receive the details and use the model to predict the result. 


## Tech Stack

- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- catboost
- xgboost
- dill
- Flask

## Data source

Kaggle Link : - [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams?datasetId=74977](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams?datasetId=74977)

- Data send contains the Gender, Ethnicity, Parental level of education, Lunch and Test preparation course by the students in various subjects.

- The data consists of 8 column and 1000 rows.

- ***The final model used is: Linear Regression***
- ***Metrics used: R2_Score***
- Why choose precision as metrics:
  Since the objective of this problem is to predict the math score with accuracy have used R¬≤ Score. The R¬≤ Score, also known as the Coefficient of Determination, is a popular metric for evaluating regression models. It explains how well the predicted values from your model approximate the actual data points.

    R¬≤ Score is used when we care about how much variance in the target variable is captured by the model.

    Conclusion: In our case, since we need to predict the score without much varriance  we will use R¬≤ Score as our metric.




## Lessons learned and recommendation

During our analysis we have found the below: 
 
- Student's Performance is related with lunch, race, parental level education
- Females lead in pass percentage and also are top-scorers
- Student's Performance is not much related with test preparation course
- Finishing preparation course is benefitial.


## Limitation and what can be improved

- Accuracy of the model is 88.04 for Linear Regression. Since there is not much difference between Ridge and Linear Regression we choose Linear Regression as our model. Accuracy can be improved further by Fine Tunning the model further.
- Application can deployed in AWS or Azure. Have tried implementing in AWS and Azure But not shown in the Project. Even have tried setting in Docker. 
- Current Dataset is not having much features. Project can be improved by using a Dataset with more features.
